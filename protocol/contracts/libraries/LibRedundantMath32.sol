 * @title LibRedundantMath variation of Open Zeppelin's Safe Math library for uint32.
 * @dev Newly developed code should not use this library. Instead opt for native arithmetic operators.
 *
 * This library replicates the behavior of 0.7 SafeMath libraries for 0.8. Safe math is unnecessary
 * in solidity ^0.8, so the functionality here is mostly redundant with default arithmetic
 * operators. However, manually updating over 1000 math operations throughout the repo was
 * deemed too likely to introduce logic errors. Instead, the original syntax was kept
 * and the underlying logic updated to be 0.8 appropriate.
